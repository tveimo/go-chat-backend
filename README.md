# go-chat-backend
A backend for a websocket based chat with channels, user registration etc.

Work in progress, I'm currently planning to move to sqlx, and use protobuf for some of the API endpoints.

I'm also exploring different frontends using kotlin for native android, react and react native, and these projects are not up to a presentable level yet.
